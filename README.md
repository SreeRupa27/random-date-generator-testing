# random-date-generator-testing

The purpose of this testing is to evaluate the functionality, accuracy, and reliability of the random date generator available at: https://codebeautify.org/generate-random-date

This testing involves generating random dates within a specified range and validating whether the generated dates meet expected conditions.

I followed the following process to conduct the testing and uploaded relevant files, each named accordingly:

**Requirements Analysis:**
I started by defining the key requirements in the form of user stories, which helped clarify the objectives of the testing and ensure the desired functionalities were covered. The user stories outlined expected behaviors, such as generating dates within the given range and ensuring randomization.

**Test Plan:**
I then created a Test Plan, which includes the testing objectives, scope, and the testing approach. The test plan clearly defined what was in scope (validating the generated dates) and what was outside the scope (other features of the website).

**Test Scenarios and Test Cases:**
Next, I developed Test Scenarios that covered the core functionalities. Each scenario was further broken down into Test Cases, specifying the test data, expected results, and steps to follow for each test. The test cases addressed various edge cases, such as verifying date boundaries and ensuring correct date formats.

**Test Execution Report:**
After executing the test cases, I documented the results in the Test Execution Report. This report includes a summary of the test outcomes, indicating the pass and fail percentages, and highlighting key findings. The report also outlines the status of each individual test case executed during the process.

**Defects and Improvements:**
In the Defects and Improvements document, I outlined any defects observed during testing, including issues like incorrect date generation or failure to adhere to specified date ranges. Additionally, I provided suggestions for improvements based on my observations, such as enhancements to randomization logic or date boundary validation.

Each of the documents is uploaded with the corresponding file name for easy access and review.
