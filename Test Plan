**Test Objectives:**

To verify that the Random Date Generator tool generates random dates within the specified date range.
To verify that the tool generates the correct number of dates as specified by the user.
To verify that the tool supports different date formats as specified by the user.
To identify any bugs or usability issues with the tool.

**Scope:**

The test focuses on:
Functional Testing : checking correct output based on inputs
Boundary Value Testing : valid start/end dates
Negative Testing : handling invalid inputs
UI Validation : ensuring correct user interaction
Integration with other systems or external data sources will not be covered in this scope.

**Testing Approach:**

Functional Testing – Validate correct date generation based on user inputs.
Boundary Value Testing – Test the minimum (Example:2020-01-01) and maximum (Example:2099-12-31) limits.
Negative Testing – Check system behavior for invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect formats).
UI Validation – Ensure correct format selection and display.
Equivalence Partitioning – Divide input values into valid and invalid partitions (e.g., valid months 1-12, invalid 13+).
Boundary Value Analysis – Test edge cases like 12-31 23:59:59 and 01-01 00:00:00.
