Requirements for Random Date Genartor in the form of user stories:

*User story1:* As a user, I want to be able to generate a specified number of random dates within a given date range, so that I can use them for various purposes such as testing or data analysis.

Acceptance Criteria:
The user can input the desired number of dates.
The user can specify the start and end dates of the range.
The tool generates the specified number of random dates within the given range.
The generated dates are displayed in the specified format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss).
The tool handles invalid input (e.g., negative number of dates, invalid date formats, start date greater than end date) with appropriate error messages.

*User Story 2:* As a user, I want to be able to customize the date format of the generated dates, so that I can use them in different applications with varying date formatting requirements.

Acceptance Criteria:
The user can select from a list of predefined date formats or select a custom date format.
The tool generates dates in the specified custom format.
The tool supports common date format specifiers (e.g., YYYY, MM, DD, hh, mm, ss).
The tool handles invalid custom date formats with appropriate error messages.

*User Story 3:* As a user, I want the generated dates to be truly random, so that I can use them for unbiased simulations and data analysis.

Acceptance Criteria:
The generated dates should not exhibit any patterns or biases.
The tool should use a robust random number generator to ensure the randomness of the dates.
The tool should be able to generate dates uniformly distributed within the specified range.

*User Story 4:* As a user, I want to be able to easily copy and paste the generated dates, so that I can easily use them in other applications.

Acceptance Criteria:
The generated dates are displayed in a clear and easy-to-read format.
The user should able to copy the generated dates to the clipboard using copy option.

*User Story 5:* As a user, I want to be able to easily download the generated dates in the form a text file, so that I can easily use them in other applications.

Acceptance Criteria:
The generated dates are displayed in a clear and easy-to-read format.
The user should able to download the generated dates using download option.

*User Story 6:* As a user, I want the tool to be easy to use and accessible from different devices, so that I can use it conveniently when needed.

Acceptance Criteria:
The tool has a simple and intuitive user interface.
The tool is responsive and works well on different devices (desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones).
The tool is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., screen reader compatibility).
